# Week 8
## CSS
Once I got the concepts down for this week, I had relatively few problems getting through it.  I think that the idea of moving into something new and different was really the hardest part about this week's assignment. Once I understood how to link fonts into the css and index files, things got a lot easier.  I was kind of worried about that particular part because I have had a few issues in the past with linking files together.
To begin with, my page looked like this:

Once I inserted colors and fonts into the css file, it looked like this:
![screenshot2](img/screenshot2.png)
I was really surprised with how easy creating the css file was.  As long as I knew exactly what I needed to include, typing it in and linking it to certain parts of my html file was pretty simple.
