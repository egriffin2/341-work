    <h2 class = "heading2">Summary</h2>
    	<p class = "text">On December 5th, 1872, the crew of the Dei Gratia
         discovered the <i>Mary Celeste,</i> abandoned, 400 miles
          from the Azores.  The ship had left for Genoa, Italy
          several days earlier but would never reach its
          destination.  The captain of the Dei Gratia,
          David Morehouse, ordered his crew aboard to further
          investigate the situation.  Once aboard, Morehouse's
          crew discovered that the <i>Mary Celeste</i> was
          completely abandoned, not only but its crew but also
          by the captain, Spooner Briggs, his wife Sarah, and
          their young daughter, two year old Sophia.  It
          appeared that the inhabitants of the ship had left
          in a hurry, leaving their belongings behind.  Several
          feet of water was left standing at the bottom of the
          ship, and the crew had disassembled one of the two
          pumps.  The single lifeboat that the <i>Mary Celeste</i>
          had been equipped with was nowhere to be found.<br>
        <h2 class = "heading2">Conclusion</h2><br>
          <p class = "text">Since there was no obvious reason for the ship to have
          been abandoned, the crew of the <i>De Gratia</i> speculated;
          could it have been water spouts? Pirates? Mutiny?
          Or even sea monsters?  Others speculated that the <i>De Gratia</i>
          crew may have been repsponsible for the disappearance of those
          aboard the <i>Mary Celeste</i>.  Despite plenty of research
          and speculation in all the years since the discovery of the
          abandoned ship, the mystery of the <i>Mary Celeste</i> remains unsolved.<br><br>
