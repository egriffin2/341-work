This is a paragraph. This paragraph requires no extra markup to signify it as such.

An empty line between text blocks signifies a new paragraph.

To mark certain words as bold we surround them with two **asterisks**. To mark certain words as emphasized or italic we surround them with a single *asterisk*.

Link text is placed between square brackets, and the associated URL link follows between parenthesis. [This is an example link](https://michaelmusick.com)

Similar to links, images are added with an exclamation mark, followed by square brackets with an image description, finally followed by the exact or relative url to the image in paranthesis. ![This is an Example Image](../imgs/markdown_example_in_atom.jpg)

We can identify code in a paragraph using the back-tick character. The back-tick is the leftmost key on number line, below the esc key on most American keyboards. `var Der = 20`.

We can write code blocks by surrounding our lines of code with three backticks. After the opening set of backticks, you should write the language you are writing (ie. markdown, html, css, javascript). See [https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/] for more info.

Lists are simply line items prepended with dashes to create an unordered list or numbers to create an ordered list.
- list item 1
- list item 2

1. List item 1
2. List item 2

Lastly, you can further extend markdown with HTML. This is particularily useful for adding embedded videos from [YouTube](youtube.com). You will be shown how to do this in the coming weeks.
