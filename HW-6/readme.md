# Week 6 Readme
## Final HTML-Only Assignment

For this project I chose to create an alien pest control type website, which
was the only thing I could think of that could possibly be more ridiculous
than the human test that I made last week. There was really no reason
that I chose this topic other than that it seemed fun and humorous enough

As usual, the process started out smoothly. I found the metadata concept really
interesting. I had heard of metadata before but never really known what it was
or what it was used for, so it was really interesting to learn about that and
understand how it is used with search engines and browsers.

I was kind of concerned at first about finding a video that met the "fair public
use" requirement, but that ended up being no problem. Actually using the videos in my pages seemed really intimidating, since there are so many different parts to it.
