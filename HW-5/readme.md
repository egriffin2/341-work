# Week 5 ReadMe
## Forms

When I started reading through the material for this week and looking at the form examples (specifically the username and password ones), the first thing that came to mind was the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ7DBG3ISRY">Password Rant </a href> video by Tobuscus, which is what gave me the idea to make The Human Test. As ridiculous as that sounds, that really is how I got my idea for this week's page.

Work on the assignment went smoothly as usual, with only the occasional hiccup caused by my oversight of small things, which were easily fixed.  For example, when creating my dropdown menu, I forgot to include actual text values, so it ended up looking like this.

![dropdown](https://github.com/egriffin2/341-work/blob/master/HW-5/img/dropdown.png)
I quickly realized that I had forgotten to put actual text values in for these options, which is why they weren't showing up.

Another problem I had was that originally, I used checkboxes where I should've used a radio input.
![checkbox2](https://github.com/egriffin2/341-work/blob/master/HW-5/img/checkbox2.png)
I was kind of concerned when I realized that they could both be checked at once, so I went back and re-read some thing.  This of course, allowed me to fix the problem right away.

Other than that I'm not really sure what to say about the whole project. I really enjoyed it, and everything is making pretty good sense to me. I learned a lot about organization in this assignment.  The fieldset tag really helped to set everything into specific categories, so the site was easy to navigate both in the code itself and in the browser. I'm not really sure what else to elaborate on in this Readme, since this was really all the issues I had with the project.
