    <h1>Emily Griffin</h1>
    <p>Hello World!</p>
    <p>This is my <em>first</em> web page!!!</p>
    <h1>Again</h1>
    <h2>By Ross Gay</h2>
    <p>Because I love you, and beneath the uncountable stars <br>
I have become the delicate piston threading itself through your chest,<br>
<br>
I want to tell you a story I shouldn’t but will and in the meantime neglect, Love,<br>
the discordant melody spilling from my ears but attend,<br>
<br>
instead, to this tale, for a river burns inside my mouth<br>
and it wants both purgation and to eternally sip your thousand drippings;<br>
<br>
and in the story is a dog and unnamed it leads to less heartbreak,<br>
so name him Max, and in the story are neighborhood kids<br>
<br>
who spin a yarn about Max like I’m singing to you, except they tell a child,<br>
a boy who only moments earlier had been wending through sticker bushes<br>
<br>
to pick juicy rubies, whose chin was, in fact, stained with them,<br>
and combining in their story the big kids make<br>
<br>
the boy who shall remain unnamed believe Max to be sick and rabid,<br>
and say his limp and regular smell of piss are just two signs,<br>
<br>
but the worst of it, they say, is that he’ll likely find you in the night,<br>
and the big kids do not giggle, and the boy does not giggle,<br>
<br>
but lets the final berries in his hand drop into the overgrowth<br>
at his feet, and if I spoke the dream of the unnamed boy<br>
<br>
I fear my tongue would turn an arm of fire so I won’t, but<br>
know inside the boy’s head grew a fire beneath the same stars<br>
<br>
as you and I, Love, your leg between mine, the fine hairs<br>
on your upper thigh nearly glistening in the night, and the boy,<br>
<br>
the night, the incalculable mysteries as he sleeps with a stuffed animal<br>
tucked beneath his chin and rolls tight against his brother<br>
<br>
in their shared bed, who rolls away, and you know by now<br>
there is no salve to quell his mind’s roaring machinery<br>
<br>
and I shouldn’t tell you, but I will,<br>
the unnamed boy<br>
<br>
on the third night of the dreams which harden his soft face<br>
puts on pants and a sweatshirt and quietly takes the spade from the den<br>
<br>
and more quietly leaves his house where upstairs his father lies dreamless,<br>
and his mother bends her body into his,<br>
<br>
and beneath these same stars, Love, which often, when I study them,<br>
seem to recede like so many of the lies of light,<br>
<br>
the boy walks to the yard where Max lives attached to a steel cable<br>
spanning the lawn, and the boy brings hot dogs which he learned<br>
<br>
from Tom & Jerry, and nearly urinating in his pants he tosses them<br>
toward the quiet and crippled thing limping across the lawn,<br>
<br>
the cable whispering above the dew-slick grass, and Max whimpers,<br>
and the boy sees a wolf where stands this ratty<br>
<br>
and sad and groveling dog and beneath these very stars<br>
Max raises his head to look at the unnamed boy<br>
<br>
with one glaucous eye nearly glued shut<br>
and the other wet from the cool breeze and wheezing<br>
<br>
Max catches the gaze of the boy who sees,<br>
at last, the raw skin on the dog's flank, the quiver<br>
<br>
of his spindly legs, and as Max bends his nose<br>
to the franks the boy watches him struggle<br>
<br>
to snatch the meat with gums, and bringing the shovel down<br>
he bends to lift the meat to Max's toothless mouth,<br>
<br>
and rubs the length of his throat and chin,<br>
Max arching his neck with his eyes closed, now,<br>
<br>
and licking the boy's round face, until the boy unchains the dog,<br>
and stands, taking slow steps backward through the wet grass and feels,<br>
<br>
for the first time in days, the breath in his lungs, which is cool,<br>
and a little damp, spilling over his small lips, and he feels,<br>
<br>
again, his feet beneath him, and the earth beneath them, and starlings<br>
singing the morning in, and the somber movement of beetles<br>
<br>
chewing the leaves of the white birch, glinting in the dark, and he notices,<br>
Darling, an upturned nest beneath the tree, and flips it looking for the blue eggs<br>
<br>
of robins, but finds none, and placing a rumpled crimson feather in his mouth<br>
slips the spindly thicket into another tree, which he climbs<br>
<br>
to watch the first hint of light glancing above the fields, and the boy<br>
eventually returns to his thorny fruit bush where an occasional prick<br>
<br>
leaves on his arm or leg a spot of blood the color of these raspberries<br>
and tasting of salt, and filling his upturned shirt with them he beams<br>
<br>
that he could pull from the earth that which might make you smile,<br>
Love, which you’ll find in the fridge, on the bottom shelf, behind the milk,<br>
<br>
in the bowl you made with your own lovely hands. </p>
