# Week 11
###Parallax
This was a disaster.  Creating the site itself was not a problem but once
I started to try and figure out the actually parallex scrolling it was a mess.
I kept trying different things to try and get the pictures to show up but what

Things got so convoluted and messy at one point that I decided to go back and restart my CSS file just so that I coudl make sure I only had what I needed in it.  While going through the code examples in the lesson and trying to add in what I needed, I ended up with an extremely messy css file.  Once I did that, I started to get somewhere but my image would not show up at all.
