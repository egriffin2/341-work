      <p>Leatherback sea turtles are endangered, and one of Pacuare's focuses is to aid in conservation
        efforts for these animals.  Leatherbacks are huge, weighing somewhere between 550 and 1500 lbs
        and growing to be anywhere from 6 - 7.2 feet in length as adults.</p>

      <p>Pacuare is open to volunteers who want to take part in the everyday activity of the reserve.
          Volunteers accompany research assistants on nightly patrols to look for nesting mothers and
