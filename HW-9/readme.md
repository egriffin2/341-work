# Week 9
### CSS Continued
This week was a disaster, mostly because of my tendency to procrastinate.
I had a lot of issues setting up the dropdown menu even though this is a
fairly simple thing to do.  Eventually, after plenty of experimenting, I
figured out how to make a dropdown menu work.  The next thing that gave me
issues was aligning the unordered list I created horizontally.  This, like
the dropdown menu, was a simple task that I overcomplicated.  Most of what
I did in this project was just the result of me looking back through the
lesson and applying what I saw as best I could in relation to what I had
already made in my index and css files.  Eventually, I got to a point in
the week where I just needed to get <i>something</i> created and turned in,
which is what I ended up doing.
